# Boop the snake

A game about [booping snakes](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/e9/bd/0ce9bd6f0717f818f2f277187cfca9c7.jpg)

## About the game

This game reflects my passion for snakes while creatively involving Python OOP.
I've noticed that people consider all snakes as dangerous creatures and I would like to change their point of view.

The main purpose of Boop the snake if to teach people to recognize snakes in nature.
Not all snakes are dangerous for humans - they rather help ecosystem to stay balanced by providing pest control.

## How it works

In one trip, there are five randomly generated snakes and player is faced with options on what to do.
Ideally player would learn about the looks, venomousness and interesting facts from repeated game attempts.

## Development

For now the game is running on command line and is text based but in a future I would love to see it in graphics.

## Note

Booping snakes in the game is a mere tool how to gain points and I don't recommend it in a real life.
Wildlife animals should be left alone.
